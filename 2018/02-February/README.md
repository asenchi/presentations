# Common Problems Running Kubernetes in Production - A Q&A with Ralph from Heptio
### Presented by Ralph Bankston

Ralph Bankston, Support Manager at Heptio, will be visiting Ann Arbor to enlighten us about the most frequent complications he's seen with Kubernetes in Production. Heâ€™ll talk about emerging patterns and workloads along with common pain points on Kubernetes. Ralph has a deep background in DevOps with over a decade in tech from application engineering to network administration. In addition, we'll have Jeffrey Sica presenting on his home infrastructure run entirely in Kubernetes! Plus, Steve Coffman will talk about why Fluentbit is great and how to follow the 12factorapp collection principal. And of course, dinner will be provided by the CNCF (Thanks Bob)! Many Thanks to Atomic Object for allowing us to host there this month!
