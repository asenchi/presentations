# Serverless Applications on AWS
### Presented by Nicholas Klick

This month, Nicholas Klick will be talking on AWS Lambda.

Serverless architectures offer DevOps professionals the ability write highly scalable applications without provisioning a single server.
In this wide-ranging talk we will explore the practical applications of serverless technologies, such as AWS Lambda, and demonstrate how they can interact with other cloud services like queues, databases and API gateways. We will explore the tradeoffs involved in developing serverless applications, dive into the code through numerous examples and also investigate how to orchestrate serverless configurations using Terraform.

Nicholas Klick is a Lead Engineer for ActBlue, the largest political fundraising platform in the US. He has over 10 years experience in DevOps and building web applications that serve tens of millions of users. Nicholas has been an invited to present at ChefConf and Hashiconf on topics related to PCI security and DevOps.

As always, food will be provided. We look forward to seeing everyone there!
