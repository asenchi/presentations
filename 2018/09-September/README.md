# Terraform Best Practices in a Team Environment
### Presented by Curt Micol

This month, we have the Heptionian Curt Micol discussing some best practices for HashiCorp's Terraform in a team environment!

Terraform is a fantastic tool for managing infrastructure but can be difficult to use across a team larger than one individual. Curt will discuss the remote state management features of Terraform, including methods for isolating changes in order to lower the risk when applying terraform plans.

As always, food will be provided. Find Curt on Twitter: https://twitter.com/asenchi
